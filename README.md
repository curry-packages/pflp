# Probabilistic Functional Logic Programming (PFLP)

PFLP is a library for probabilistic programming in the functional logic programming language [Curry](https://www-ps.informatik.uni-kiel.de/currywiki/).
The library is based on the ideas presented in the paper [Probabilistic Functional Logic Programming](https://www-ps.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~sad/padl2018-preprint.pdf).
